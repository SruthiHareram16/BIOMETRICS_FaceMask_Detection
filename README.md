# BIOMETRICS_FaceMask_Detection
Developed a model to detect whether people wearing face masks or not. We have developed our model and trained with different datasets that are avalilable in online platforms. All model are saved in '.h5' file formats which you can find above out of all the models ```mask_recog_ver3``` is the best with 98.78% accuracy. 

# CODE RUNNING INSTRUCTIONS
1. Download the code and ```mask_recog_ver3.h5``` model, save it in a folder.
2. Execute the ```webcam.py``` file.
3. Make sure model and webcam python file are in same folder.
4. After executing the file you can see that the webcam window will be opened, where you can see that the model detecting faces with masks and without masks.
